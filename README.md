# Machine Learning Assignments

This repository contains a list of the assignments that were given as a part of the **Machine Learning(CSL7620)** course for **M.Tech AI**, first year at Indian Insitute of Technology, Jodhpur.

## Assignment 1: Linear Regression

In this assignment we had to implement **Linear regression** from scratch and use it on a synthetic dataset.

The assignment contains also contains some pre-processing of the dataset which was necessary for better perfromance of the model.

## Assignment 2: K-Means Clustering and GMM with PCA

This assignment contains 2 tasks:

**Task 1:** In task 1 we had to implement K-Means clustering algorithm on the **MNIST dataset**. We had to write the algorithm from scratch and cluster the datapoints in 10, 6 and 4 clusters.

**Task 2:** In the second task we had to apply **Principal Component Analysis** on the dataset to reduce it to lower dimensions and then cluster it using **Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM).**

## Assignment 3: Artificial Neural Network

In this assignment we had to implement an **Artificial Neural Network** with multiple hidden layders from scratch and use it for classification in **Fashion MNIST** dataset.
The classification was done on multiple train-test splits for 25 epochs and comparison was done.
